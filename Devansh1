# Installing Istio

## First make sure you have a Kubernetes enviornment
Get and install kubectl:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl

If you don't have a Kubernetes environment, the quickest way to get one running is likely via minikube:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-Kubernetes/

## We'll also leverage Helm to install the pieces of our Istio enviornment
Get and install helm for your environment:

https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm

*Note*: If you are installing helm into a public environment, it is always a good idea to follow the instructions for securing your Helm installation with a client side certificate.  If you are following along and using minikube, you can ignore the warning for now.

##  Then we can get and install the Istio components
